        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a reserved person and although to some it may seem like a weakness, i believe that my personality is
          comvlimented bv mv characteristics. l‘m analytical which means that I take calculated risks acccunting for
          failure and I set contingencies based on that. I am constantly adding to and changing the pians I have for the
          future but regardless it is straightfurward and thought out. I aspire to learn and improve on my programmirig
          skills so that I am able to use my skills to help grow the digital footprint of my immediate community</p>
